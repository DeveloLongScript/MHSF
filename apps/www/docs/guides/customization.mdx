# Customize your server
Customizing your server is very easy after you have [linked your account](Docs:guides/linking). Make sure you have done that before then.

## Getting started
Make sure you've also [owned your server](Docs:guides/owning-a-server).

## Customization Types
### Discord Server
Enable the server widget in your Discord server settings, and copy and paste in the Discord server ID, and your Discord server will appear!

### Banner
Your server must have an image from [Imgur](https://imgur.com), and can be any image type that can be rendered on the web. Copy and paste the link (not the link after uploading the image, but by right clicking and hitting "Copy Image Address") into the input box!

### Color Scheme
You can pick any color in the box and choosing a color scheme to show on your server specificly.

### Description
You can use Markdown formatting to add a description to describe what your server is.

## Thats it!
