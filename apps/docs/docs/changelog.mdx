## Changelog

- Added new banner
 
## v2
MHSF has been a great project of mine for nearly 9 months now, however the frontend of MHSF has always been buggy and complex to modify. MHSF was built at first as a project that was expected to only last a week & be one of my many abandoned projects, meaning it was not meant to have the best code. v2 is a complete redo of the frontend from the server-list to your settings, expecting to look even better than before.

I always didn't have the best idea of UI concepts for the project, and when it started I was definitely worse than where I was at this point. v2 is expected to change that with my own custom UI that very much looks a lot better than pre-v2 MHSF. And of course, it will be fully open-source along-side MHSF and documented for others to use in their own projects, and will be aimed to be compatible with shadcn/ui for an ideal developer experience.

From the bottom of my heart, I am very grateful for the relatively small amount of support we got with this project and with v2, we are expected to do even better and bring in more people. Always remember you can contact me on Discord (`@giftedly`) if you have any suggestions, bug issues (or use GitHub issues) or anything else related to MHSF done for you, it would be greatly appreciated.

Happy valentines y'all. See you guys when v2 is done. üíó

## More about our domain change

For the past months or so, we were using the https://list.mlnehut.com domain. (yes, the website is still a rickroll üòÜ ) I was not intending for the long-term to use this domain, but I didn't have the time to actually buy a domain then. The old domain was provided by Tarna, thanks! However, now I've moved MHSF to a simplistic domain, MHSF!

I hope I can update MHSF more and more going into the holiday season! ‚ù§Ô∏è

<Update label="v1.3.2" description="Oct 4, 2024">
## Changelog
- Some minor backend changes

FYI: Hey! Recently I've broken my wrist, and I couldn't work on MHSF for longer. I've taken some weeks to take a break from MHSF & heal my wrist. Expect to see some new updates over the weekend and for the next weeks or so. I'm still not giving up on MHSF any time soon, and I'm working on affiliates for MHSF as well.

Thank you for sticking around for the time ‚ù§Ô∏è
