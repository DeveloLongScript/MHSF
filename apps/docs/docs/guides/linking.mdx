MHSF uses a safe & secure system to link your account that **doesn't use your Microsoft account in any way**. MHSF uses a simple system of logging into a server, and then putting a code into the website.

<Separator />

## Prerequisites

- An active account with MHSF (either linked through GitHub or Discord, or just a standard email account)
- A Minecraft Java Edition account (Bedrock accounts are not guaranteed to work, and could malfunction at some times)

## Linking

<Steps>
<Step title="Go to your account settings">
Hit your profile on the top, and go to the settings
</Step>
<Step title="Hit link account button">
If your account hasn't already been linked, you should be able to hit the Link button.
</Step>
<Step title="Pick a server">
You can pick either one of these options:
- **CoreBoxx**, a popular box server, is also a MHSF partner who has partnered to add the plugin to allow you to link through the server.
  The server should be online all day, and is recommended to use.
- **MHSFPV** was a server designed for only linking. This option is not recommended because **the server is always offline** and must be turned on manually.
</Step>
<Step title="Join your chosen server">
Join the server using either `CoreBoxx.minehut.gg` or `MHSFPV.minehut.gg`
<Info>
 Like said above, MHSFPV will most likely need to be turned on via the lobby.
</Info>
If using CoreBoxx, type the `/mhsf` command.
<Warning>
If either server denies you saying you were already linked, and you were linked before, hit the "Force unlink" link in the "Unlink" section.
This is a known bug.
</Warning>
</Step>
<Step title="Input code from server into MHSF">
Use the code from this server and input it into MHSF, and then submit.
</Step>
<Step title="You're linked!">
You should be linked.
</Step>
</Steps>

## Functions

You can do many things with a linked account:

- [Own a server](/guides/owning-a-server)
- [Customize a server](/guides/customization)

More will be coming in future updates, however the only thing you can do with a linked account is server-based functions.
