  This document will be regularly updated in accordance with new information.
</Info>

Recently, we've been in contact with Minehut staff to ensure our compliance with users & server owners that use the platform.
We've decided to compile a list of important information to ensure you will not be punished.

## MHSF Communication

As said above, we've been in contact with Minehut staff. As said in a statement:

> **Please do not abuse the APIs** or collaborate with anyone using your APIs to compromise our systems in any way.
>
> _said privately from Tim at GamerSafer_

We'd like to share what abusing the APIs that are provided by Minehut really means.

### What is considered "abusing" Minehut APIs?

There are various different things this could mean. Here is an inclusive list of what is considered "abusing" Minehut APIs (or MHSF's):

- Spamming, "DDoS"-ing or repetitively requesting information from MHSF or Minehut's API[s]
- Using MHSF or Minehut's API[s] to violate rules stated in Minehut's ruleset:
  1.  Using it directly to grab information of player's who advertise your server
  2.  To get private information about another player or user that could be used in malicious intent
- Using MHSF or Minehut's API[s] to violate legal regulations

<Warning>
  Remember, this list isn't exhaustive. There may be things that aren't listed
  here that are considered "abusing" Minehut APIs.
</Warning>

## Other information

There is not a clear punishment for users using MHSF directly _if_ Minehut wasn't happy with our service. However, for avoidance of DMCA takedowns and
cease and desists, we will have to listen to Minehut's demands. We have no choice unfortunately.

Please make sure you are following API rules from both platforms to avoid MHSF being taken down.
