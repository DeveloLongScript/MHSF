Owning a server is quite simple and allows you to [customize your server](/docs/guides/customization) and make it stand out from other servers. Before owning your server, make sure you agree to the [ECA](Docs:legal/external-content-agreement).

## Linking

<Step title="Link your account">
  If you haven't already, make sure your account has [already been linked with
  your Minecraft account](/docs/guides/linking)
</Step>

<Step title="Find your server">
  Find the server you would like to own (either by looking for it, or using the
  keyboard shortcut <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>K</kbd> and searching
  for it)
</Step>

<Step title="Server customization tab">
  Go to the server customization tab at the top.
</Step>

<Step title="Own the server">
  If the owner of the server, and the user your linked to match, you will be
  able to own your server. You should see a button named Click to own. Press
  that button, and you should automagically own the server
</Step>

## I can't link my server, because my server doesn't have a author

Your server must have an author in-order to be automagically linked, and if it doesn't have an author, that means you will have to manually link your server. To do that, make an issue on GitHub, showing that your server has no author, but needs to be linked. Show proof that you own the server, along with your account username, and your account will own the server you need.

## There is an error while linking my server!

This most likely is because the Minehut API is blocking the server-side request to verify your the owner of that server, or your server [has no author](#i-cant-link-my-server-because-my-server-doesnt-have-a-author).
Try again in 30 minute intervals, or just make an issue on GitHub to link your server.
