Customizing your server is very easy after you have [linked your account](/docs/guides/linking). Make sure you have done that before then.

## Getting started

Make sure you've also [owned your server](/docs/guides/owning-a-server).

## Customization Types

### Discord Server

Enable the server widget in your Discord server settings, and copy and paste in the Discord server ID, and your Discord server will appear!
You can see the people inside of your server, and how many are online, along with a link to your server.

### Banner

Your server can have an image from anywhere, and can be any _static_ image type that can be rendered on the web. Copy and paste the link (not the link after uploading the image, but by right clicking and hitting "Copy Image Address") into the input box!

<Warning>
  Except for images hosted by Imgur, `wsrv.nl` is used to make sure users aren't
  IP logged.
</Warning>

### Color Scheme

You can pick any color in the box and choosing a color scheme to show on your server specificly.

### Description

You can use Markdown formatting to add a description to describe what your server is.

## Thats it!
