# Reading the docs
The documentation in MHSF has some special symbols used in the docs that might be useful to know.

<Separator/>

## Icons
When looking at a link, there will be symbols used that indicate where the link is going: *(these apply to the whole site)*
 - <Notebook className="inline-block mb-1" size={20}/> indicates the link will link to the [official Minehut wiki](Wiki:/)
 - <Book className="inline-block mb-1" size={20} /> indicates the link will link to another page on the docs
 - <ExternalLink className="inline-block mb-1" size={20}/> indicates the link will go to an external site

When contributing, these links are as follows:
```
Wiki:<wiki url after https://minehut.wiki.gg/wiki/>
Docs:<docs url after /docs/>
Special:Root (links back to /)
https://example.com

**Example:**
[Ranks](Wiki:Ranks)
[Getting Started](Docs:Getting-started)
https://google.com
```

The icons above will be automatically added when using the syntax above. <br/>
