# External Content Agreement (ECA)

By making external content available for anyone to see, there needs to
be an agreement to keep MHSF ("Minehut Server List") a friendly place
for anyone to look at. _As such, this agreement outlines what you can't and can do, when making content on the platform._ The goal by making an agreement like this, is not to make you worried
what you can upload, its just showing what the limits of content
uploaded onto the platform are.

## Source Code

The source code for MHSF is defined by the [MIT License](Special:GitHub/blob/main/LICENSE). You are free to use MHSF for commercial use, and you may modify the software however you'd like. Taking copies of the software (aka _"forking"_) is also freely allowed.

## What your limits are

When creating content, if its a matter of making a profile picture,
or editing the description for a server, (and more), you must follow
the underlying agreements below.<br/>
For making banners & descriptions, you must follow [Minehuts Terms of Service](Wiki:Rules) _as all content made is associated to Minehut (as the server is mostly on a community for Minehut)._<br/>
For making Discord server embeds, you must follow [Discords Terms of Service](https://discord.com/terms/) _as all content made is associated to Discord._

### All other content

For all other content, they must follow the following:

- No inappropriate/adult images
- No swear words of any kind or slurs
- Endorsing unethical client modifications (aka cheating or hacking)

## When you agree to the ECA

When you add customization to your server, or add a profile picture (linking an account is included), you must follow the ECA.

## When linking an account

When linking an account, you must follow the privacy policy and terms of service to the associated service that you linked your MHSF account to. Additionally, if you link an external account{" "}
_after_ account creation, everything said before is still true.

## Violations

Violations from above have 1 warning. Your first interaction is a warning by removing the content from MHSF, and your 2nd is banning/deleting your account. (some violations are an instant delete)

## Reporting

If you personally see a violation of the ECA, you can report it by clicking the customization tab on a server, and hitting the Report
button (it doesn't appear when the server was never owned). If you misuse this feature, you may get your account deleted.
