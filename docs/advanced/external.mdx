# External Servers on Minehut
I think creating external servers on Minehut is a advanced subject, and it is not documented well enough for the circumstances that
might occur with server owners. This is a [extension/rephrasing of the offical wiki guide](https://minehut.wiki.gg/wiki/External). All points in **bold** are things you shouldn't miss, and are commonly misread.

<br/>
<Separator/>
_Note: This is an unoffical guide, but the offical way of connecting! This is safe!_
## Getting started
You must pick a host that allows the following when making external servers:
 - **Editing server flags** Editing flags for the server to run is essential. There are many cases where you were not able to continue because your provider was resetting your flags back
 - **A supported server software** For standalone servers, you must run on [Paper](https://papermc.io/software/paper). For proxy networks, you can use [Velocity](https://velocitypowered.com/), [Waterfall](https://papermc.io/software/waterfall) & [Lilypad](https://www.lilypadmc.org/). **BungeeCord is not supported by any means!**

Minehut offically recommends Velocity, which you can find instructions [here](https://docs.papermc.io/velocity/getting-started) to get going! If you do not wish to use a proxy, using Paper is recommended, which you can find a guide [here](https://docs.papermc.io/paper/getting-started).
Before doing below, **make sure your proxy _actually works!_**

## Changing flags
To ensure that Minehut can properly connect your players to your server, you need to add flags when booting up your server. These are commonly in `start.bat` or `start.sh` for Linux-based hosts. **Players cannot join your server from Minehut without adding these flags!**


### Velocity
Add the following `sessionserver` flag to your start script:
 ```
 -Dmojang.sessionserver=https://api.minehut.com/mitm/proxy/session/minecraft/hasJoined
 ```
  All flags put together should look like the following:
  ```
  java -Dmojang.sessionserver=https://api.minehut.com/mitm/proxy/session/minecraft/hasJoined -jar velocity.jar
  ```

### Paper - standalone
 Like said above, if you run a proxy, add the flags for Velocity. **Adding both the Velocity (or any other proxy server) & Paper flags will cause your server to be unauthenticatable!** <br/>
   Add the following `auth.host`, `account.host`, `services.host` & `session.host` flags:
   ```
   -Dminecraft.api.auth.host=https://authserver.mojang.com/
   -Dminecraft.api.account.host=https://api.mojang.com/
   -Dminecraft.api.services.host=https://api.minecraftservices.com/
   -Dminecraft.api.session.host=https://api.minehut.com/mitm/proxy
   ```
   All the script together
   ```
   java -Dminecraft.api.auth.host=https://authserver.mojang.com/ -Dminecraft.api.account.host=https://api.mojang.com/ -Dminecraft.api.services.host=https://api.minecraftservices.com/ -Dminecraft.api.session.host=https://api.minehut.com/mitm/proxy -jar paper.jar 
   ``` 
   **Along with this,** make sure to set the `enforce-secure-profile` flag in the `server.properties` file to `false`.
    ```
    enable-status=true
    # Set this to false!
    enforce-secure-profile=false
    enforce-whitelist=false
    ```


### Lilypad
Set the following environment variable `LILYPAD_MOJANG_SESSIONSERVER_URL` to `https://api.minehut.com/mitm/proxy/session/minecraft/hasJoined`. Environment variables are set as a seperate command in the start script:
```
LILYPAD_MOJANG_SESSIONSERVER_URL="https://api.minehut.com/mitm/proxy/session/minecraft/hasJoined"
```
If above doesn't work, try this:
```
export LILYPAD_MOJANG_SESSIONSERVER_URL="https://api.minehut.com/mitm/proxy/session/minecraft/hasJoined"
```

## Enable Proxy Protocol
_Note: Skip this step if you're using [TCPShield](https://tcpshield.com/) for DDoS protection._

Enable proxy protocol in your proxy's configuration file: 
### Velocity

In velocity.toml under advanced, set
```
haproxy-protocol = true
```
### Waterfall

In config.yml under listeners, set
```
proxy_protocol: true
```
### Paper

In config/paper-global.yml under proxies, set
```
proxy-protocol: true
```

## Thats it!
After this, there are mostly no more common issues. Continue on [the wiki](https://minehut.wiki.gg/wiki/External#Connect_Your_External_Server_Plan_on_Minehut)!
