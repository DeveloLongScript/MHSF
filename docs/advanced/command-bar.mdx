# Using the Command-bar

The command-bar has many mods and is a great tool for power-users to use as its built to be fast, while showing optimal information to the scenario

<Separator />

## Triggering the command-bar

There are two ways to trigger the command bar, using `Ctrl+K` and `Ctrl+Shift+K`. Both put you in a command-bar, however when using `Ctrl+K`, you go into a general page with other settings.
Using `Ctrl+Shift+K` opens a server viewer, and this may be faster then going through the general page.

## Functions using `Ctrl+K`

- **Servers** opens a server list, same as `Ctrl+Shift+K`
- **Sort Servers** allows you to go into a sorted server list quickly
- **Links** shows links useful for MHSF
- **Pick Random Server** picks a random server and shows the user what that server is, is similar to the one on [the server list](/)

  **Profile (requires log-in):**
- **Favorites** shows the user their favorited servers
- **User Settings** shows the user the settings for Clerk

## Servers

This view shows the most popular 50 servers, and when searching, you can search for any server that exists (offline or online).
When clicking on a server, you see a simple view showing information about the server, along with a link to the server page.

## Trigger from information popover

Click the top-right info button, and click Open Commands. This will open the same `Ctrl+K` command-bar, if you would like to use it on mobile.
