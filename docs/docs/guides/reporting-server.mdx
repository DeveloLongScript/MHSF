If you believe a server that you've seen is under breach of the [Rules](/docs/legal/rules), you may request the server in question to be taken down.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Before starting..">
    - Make sure you are logged into a account
  </Step>
  <Step title="Go to server page">
    Find the server you would like to own (either by looking for it, or using
    the keyboard shortcut <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>K</kbd> and
    searching for it)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Customization tab">Go to the customization tab</Step>
  <Step title="Report server">
    <Warning>
      This will send a notification to MHSF maintainers. This server must be in
      violation of the <Link href="/docs/legal/rules">Rules</Link> to be a valid
      report. Typical response times include 1 hour to 1 day, and you will not
      be notified if your report is successful or not.{" "}
      <b>
        Please do not spam this form with mindless reports. If you do, your
        account will be banned. We are not Minehut support, we cannot help you
        with a problem within the Minehut platform or within the server, we can
        only moderate the customization of the server.

      (if the problem is within the server, [report it on
      Minehut](https://support.minehut.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?tf_subject=Reporting%20Server&tf_27062997154195=reports_appeals&tf_27063229498259=report_server))
    </Warning>
    Hit the Report button, and add a reason to your report. Your report will be
    processed and the appropriate action will be taken.
  </Step>

## Issue inside the server

If an issue is inside of the server, because MHSF doesn't provide the server list source (Minehut API), you must [go to Minehut and make a ticket](https://support.minehut.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?tf_subject=Reporting%20Server&tf_27062997154195=reports_appeals&tf_27063229498259=report_server).
