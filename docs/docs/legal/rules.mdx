title: "MHSF Platform Rules"
---

MHSF is a platform & wrapper for the popular server host, Minehut, designed to be a friendly and useful location to find information
about servers, whether provided by a human or from MHSF's automated systems.

## Introduction

We simply cannot provide a service like this without rules that regulate how content is created and shared. This rule agreement ensures that MHSF content meets our project standards and protects users from inappropriate content that may not be suitable for our primary user base: Minehut players & server owners.

Generally, if you use MHSF as intended—sharing useful information about your server and engaging in appropriate interactions—you should have no issues. However, we've provided this resource to clearly define boundaries and expectations.

<Note>
  Code under MHSF is licensed under the [MIT
  License](https://github.com/DeveloLongScript/MHSF). This document pertains to
  platform usage and content, not to open-source code or how you interact on
  other platforms *operated* by MHSF (for example, GitHub issues, pull requests,
  Discord threads, etc.)
</Note>

## Jurisdiction

MHSF has a presence on various platforms. Our rules are enforced as follows:

1. **MHSF Platform Content**: All content provided on our platform as part of our customization process is subject to these rules and **will** be moderated.
   - See [Reporting](#reporting) for information on how to report violations
2. **Server Content**: Content directly on Minecraft servers should be addressed by server staff—we have **no control** over this content.
3. **Minehut-Provided Content**: Server names, MOTDs, and other content _provided by Minehut_ that appears on MHSF cannot and will not be moderated by MHSF.
   - This content is governed by [Minehut's ruleset](https://support.minehut.com/hc/en-us/articles/27075816947731-Minehut-Rules)
   - Please email [`support@minehut.com`](mailto:support@minehut.com) to report content that violates Minehut's rules.

## Content & Behavior Rules

### Prohibited Content and Behavior

Users may not:

1. **Personal Information**

   - Request, share, or disclose personally identifiable information that could negatively impact users
   - Make threats to "dox" or "swat" other users

2. **Harassment & Threats**

   - Engage in sexual harassment
   - Threaten violence, assault, or property damage
   - Harass other users in any form
   - Use terminology that discriminates against others based on race, ethnicity, national origin, sexual orientation, gender identity, religion, disability, or other immutable characteristics

3. **Harmful Content**

   - Encourage self-harm or suicide
   - Encourage users to break platform rules
   - Depict or encourage illegal activities (including drugs, weapon-making, gambling, DDoS attacks, and predatory behavior)
   - Recreate tragic events (mass shootings, terrorism, natural disasters, human rights violations)

4. **Platform Abuse**

   - Create multiple accounts to avoid punishment
   - Upload disruptive content or perform operations that harm MHSF services
   - Attempt to direct users off-platform unnecessarily
   - Attack another server's content
   - Spam, abuse, or misuse the MHSF API

5. **Scams & Manipulation**
   - Conduct scams or manipulate users into sharing personal information or valuable items
   - Sell or transfer MHSF accounts, server claims, or other platform privileges

## Enforcement & Punishment

### Standard Enforcement Process

For most violations, MHSF follows this process:

1. **First Violation**: Warning and content removal
2. **Repeated Violation**: Permanent removal from the MHSF platform

### Types of Enforcement Actions

Depending on the severity of the violation, actions may include:

- Content removal
- Temporary suspension
- Account ban
- IP ban

<Warning>
  MHSF staff may use any enforcement action necessary to effectively address
  threats to the platform. Certain serious violations will result in immediate
  permanent bans without warning.
</Warning>

## Appeals Process

If you believe your punishment was unjustified, you may appeal by contacting [support@mhsf.app](mailto:support@mhsf.app).

<Warning>
  You may only file **one appeal per punishment**. You can only have one active
  appeal at a time.
</Warning>

## Reporting violations

If you believe another user has violated these rules, you can submit a report after logging in by following our [reporting guide](/docs/guides/reporting-server).

## Additional Information

### Age Requirement

Users must be at least 13 years old to use, interact with, or sign up for MHSF and its services. Users found to be under 13 will be banned in compliance with data protection laws and Minehut regulations.

### API Usage

When using the MHSF API:

- Include a proper `User-Agent` HTTP header with your project name and link
- Do not spam or abuse the API
- Do not use the API to violate Minehut, Discord, Minecraft, or legal regulations

### Rule Changes

These rules may be modified without prior notice. MHSF staff may take action against content or behavior that undermines the platform's interests, even if not explicitly covered in this document.
