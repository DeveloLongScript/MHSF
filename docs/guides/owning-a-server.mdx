# Owning a server

Owning a server is quite simple and allows you to [customize your server](/docs/guides/customization) your server and make it stand out from other servers. Before owning your server, make sure you agree to the [ECA](Docs:legal/external-content-agreement).

## Linking

Find the server you would like to own (either by looking for it, or using the keyboard shortcut `Ctrl`+`Shift`+`K` and searching for it), and make sure your account has [already been linked with your Minecraft account](Docs:guides/linking). Go to the server, and hit the Customization tab. If the owner of the server, and the user your linked to match, you will gain access to the server.
If they match, you should see a button named Click to own. Press that button, and you should automagically own the server. Congratulations!

## I can't link my server, because my server doesn't have a author

Your server must have an author in-order to be automagically linked, and if it doesn't have an author, that means you will have to manually link your server. To do that, make an issue on GitHub, showing that your server has no author, but needs to be linked. Show proof that you own the server, along with your account username, and your account will own the server you need.
