# Reporting a server

If you believe a server that you've seen is under breach of the [ECA Agreement](Docs:legal/external-content-agreement), you may request the server in question to be taken down.
Make sure you are logged into a account, and go to the server page and hit the customization tab. Hit the Report button, and add a reason to your report.
Your report will be processed and the appropriate action will be taken.

## Issue inside the server
If an issue is inside of the server, because MHSF doesn't provide the server list source (Minehut API), you must [go to Minehut and make a ticket](https://support.minehut.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?tf_subject=Reporting%20Server&tf_27062997154195=reports_appeals&tf_27063229498259=report_server).
