# Linking your Minecraft account

MHSF uses a safe & secure system to link your account that **doesn't use your Microsoft account in any way**. MHSF uses a simple system of logging into a server, and then putting a code into the website.

<Separator />

## Prerequisites

- An active account with MHSF (either linked through GitHub or Discord, or just a standard email account)
- A Minecraft Java Edition account (Bedrock accounts are not guaranteed to work, and could malfunction at some times)

## Linking

To get started, go into your account settings (your profile picture in top-right, and Profile & Security) and click Link Account.
Login to the server `MHSFPV.minehut.gg`. (its on a free plan, you may have to start it in the lobby) Take the code shown in chat, and put it into the OTP box. Hit Submit, and if the code is correct, your account will be linked! Congratulations!

## Functions

You can do many things with a linked account:

- [Own a server](Docs:guides/owning-a-server)
- [Customize a server](Docs:guides/customization)

More will be coming in future updates, however the only thing you can do with a linked account is server-based functions.
