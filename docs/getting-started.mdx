# Getting Started to MHSF

MHSF is an open-source wrapper for the traditional Minehut server list, either in the lobby or the one [built-in to the minehut.com website directly](https://app.minehut.com/servers).
The way MHSF communicates with Minehut is using the closed Minehut API discovered by using DevTools on the original Minehut page.
Along with this, there are entries that are completely third-party like for adding descriptions or banners.

## What is a wrapper?

Wrappers are usually free & open-source software that goes on-top of existing software that may be proprietary. There are many reasons for a wrapper to exist (privacy, automation, etc.), in MHSF's case, its because the Minehut server list provided by default just doesn't cut it.
Wrappers usually communicate using an API that was provided by the service its self, making software like MHSF completely legal.

## Why to use MHSF

- **Faster response times** MHSF is completely ad-free, and as a result of being open-source, constantly tries to cut down on unnecessary things slowing down the page.
- **Open-source & no tracking** As a result of being open-source, MHSF will never track or sell your to advertisers. Anybody can look at the code, and can be verified to be completely secure.
- **Make your server stand out** Server owners can configure after appropriate verification banners, Discord widgets, descriptions & color schemes.
- **Customize your experience** Filters, sorts & different spacing settings can make your experience just how you like it while you are browsing servers.
- **Better & more intuitive UX/UI** UI is a big point for MHSF, using UI designed to be more user friendly, and to be more straight-forward then Minehut's
- **One focus** Because MHSF is only a server-list, it only has to be, _a server list!_ This means more updates and higher quality ones because all MHSF has to worry about, is the server list!

## Will you get banned for this?

No. Your Minehut account is not associated with your MHSF one, and consequently, you cannot be banned. There is no risk of getting banned by Minehut, as we are posing no threat to them. As long as you aren't spamming MHSF (or the API in general), you should be good.

## Conclusion

If you'd like to use MHSF, go to the server list [here](/) to try it out! You may also give MHSF a star on GitHub if you feel like this project deserves it.
