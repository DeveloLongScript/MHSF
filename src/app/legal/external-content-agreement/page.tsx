        <strong className="text-2xl">External Content Agreement (ECA)</strong>
        <br />
        By making external content available for anyone to see, there needs to
        be an agreement to keep MHSF ("Minehut Server List") a friendly place
        for anyone to look at.{" "}
        <i>
          As such, this agreement outlines what you can't and can do, when
          making content on the platform.
        </i>{" "}
        The goal by making an agreement like this, is not to make you worried
        what you can upload, its just showing what the limits of content
        uploaded onto the platform are.
        <br />
        <br />
        <strong className="text-xl">Source Code</strong>

          as all content made is associated to Minehut (as the server is mostly

        </i>{" "}
        <br />
        For making Discord server embeds, you must follow{" "}

        <br />
        When you add customization to your server, or add a profile picture
        (linking an account is included), you must follow the ECA.

        <br />

        <br />
        When linking an account, you must follow the privacy policy and terms of
        service to the associated service that you linked your MHSF account to.
        Additionally, if you link an external account <i>after</i> account
        creation, everything said before is still true.
        <br />
        <br />
        <strong className="text-xl">Violations</strong>
        <br />
        Violations from above have 1 warning. Your first interaction is a
        warning by removing the content from MHSF, and your 2nd is
        banning/deleting your account.
